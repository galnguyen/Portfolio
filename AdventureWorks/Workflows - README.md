**Workflows**
**1. Extract - Transform - Load Data (ETL):**  <br>
<br>
   In the first stage, I loaded the data (Excel file) into Power BI and then transformed it to ensure all data fields were defined and formatted properly. I also checked the data quality and profile to ensure no errors within the dataset. <br>
   <br>
   Since the AdventureWorks dataset is clean, no further transformation is taken. Then I loaded all the tables into PBI.  <br>

   <br>
**2. Data model:** <br><br>
    Firstly, I identified fact and dimension (dim) tables. In the original dataset, we can see 6 dim tables (for master data) and 1 fact table (for sales transaction data).  <br>
    <br>
    Secondly, I identified and set up the relationships among tables. The cardinality I use in this case is "One to many" for all relationships from the dim to the fact table (as each item is unique on a dim table and could appear in several rows in the fact table). For the relationship between the Date and Sales table, since there are 3 matches, I activated the most common one (DateKey - OrderDateKey).  <br>

    <br>
    From the data model, I brainstormed the measures needed for my report. Since AdventureWorks is a completely new case with no specific insights yet, I chose to approach the dataset holistically. That means I would see the Sales data from every angle.  <br>
    <br>
   When it comes to DAX functions, I mainly used Basic Aggregations, Time Intelligence, SWITCH, CALCULATION with FILTER, IF, and ALL functions. The measures are grouped into 5 main categories: Index (main measures such as total quantity, total sales,â€¦); Index_Benchmark (main measures with Time intelligence functions, for comparison purposes); Change (Variance between this period and a benchmarked one); Format (for formatting purpose), VMP/VMC (for variance analysis).  <br>
    <br>
**3. Visualization:**  <br>
<br>
  As I am the main audience (FP&A manager role, who detects issues and actionable insights) of this report, I created 4 dashboards: 1 overview (to quickly see if the trend goes as I expect, from various aspects) and 3 deep-dive analyses (focus on Product, Customer, Territory).  <br>
  <br>
  I sketched the dashboards I wanted to present before creating them to ensure all the visualizations were presented cohesively and coherently.  <br>
